# api-lifecycle
This repo serves my personal goal of putting my thoughts together on the API lifecycle.

There are a number of various lifecycles implemented by different organizations, teams, and developers all with mulitple personas at play. The teams interested in APIs can also fall into different groupings or viewpoints.

## Viewpoints

I will group lifecycles into two viewpoints. Firstly, those belong to the you fall into the **producer** side of the house (e.g., _teams building APIs to be consumed by other teams/developers_) and the **consumer** perspective (e.g., _those developers or teams looking to consume APIs which were developed and published by remote teams or third parties_).
