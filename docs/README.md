# api-lifecycle
This repo serves my personal goal of putting my thoughts together on the API lifecycle.

There are a number of various lifecycles implemented by different organizations, teams, and developers all with mulitple personas at play. The teams can also fall into different groupings or viewpoints.

## Viewpoints

I will group lifecycles into two viewpoints. Firstly, those belong to the you fall into the _producer_ side of the how (e.g., teams building APIs to be consumed by other teams/developers) and the _consumer_ perspective (e.g., those developers or teams looking to consume APIs which were developed and published by remote teams or third parties).
